"Citadel Diana review: Prime Video’s spy spin-off is a step up from Priyanka Chopra’s sloppy original, but that isn’t saying much","Amazon Prime Video’s ambitious Citadel universe expands this week with its second instalment. Titled Citadel: Diana, the Italian offshoot of the espionage-thriller franchise finds itself in the enviable middle-child position, unburdened by greater responsibilities, but also a little inconsequential. It isn’t good enough to revive the series, nor is it bad enough to put the final nail in its coffin. It is only if the upcoming Indian spinoff, Citadel: Honey Bunny, flops that red alerts will be sounded across the hallways of Amazon HQ. With expectations lowered to comically non-existent levels by last year’s debut season of the ‘mothership’ show, starring Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Richard Madden, all that Citadel: Diana needed to be was passable. And fortunately for us all, it does an above average job of being average.Made on a noticeably smaller scale than the original — this isn’t saying much, considering that Citadel remains one of the most expensive shows ever made, and literally everything else will appear slight when compared to it — Citadel: Diana is an odd series that devotes itself to perhaps the least interesting aspect of this entire franchise. In fact, Diana comes across as an incidental presence in her own show, which focuses instead on the internal politics of the Manticore secret organisation. This was the Spectre-like outfit headed by Lesley Manville’s character in the original, if you recall. It’s important that you do, because none of it would make sense otherwise. ...",2024-10-01,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/web-series/citadel-diana-review-matilda-de-angelis-improvement-over-priyanka-chopra-sloppy-original-9611696/,entertainment

Tavleen Singh writes: Fiscal ruin in near future,"A crime is being committed by our political leaders that is likely to have immense and irreversible consequences and it worries me that it has gone almost unnoticed. This is the crime of turning voters once more into supplicants. They were forced to be supplicants in those socialist decades when Congress ruled most of India. We had just got rid of the British and political leaders enjoyed being benefactors, or as we say in Hindi as the ‘mai-baap sarkar’. This literally means the government is our mother and father. In rural parts of our ancient land, you need only visit the Collector’s office to see that these mighty officials continue to treat people as supplicants.The Collector is a colonial post that should have been abolished long ago but inexplicably still exists. This official is so powerful that he behaves like a provincial potentate. He usually lives in the grandest bungalow, usually set in sprawling gardens and, if it is an old British official’s house, can also have a tennis court and swimming pool on the premises. Outside the Collector’s heavily secured palace are to be found, at a safe distance, queues of anxious people who sometimes come repeatedly for a small matter to be settled.

"The Third Edit: Aesthetic airport security trays, decorated fridge interiors and a common thread — the search for beauty in the banal","Anyone who is curious about the absurd lengths to which the social media-fuelled pursuit of beauty can be taken, only needs to look at two recent trends. The first is the so-called airport tray trend, which involves the artful “curation” of one’s possessions — sunglasses, watch, bag etc, besides a boarding pass and/or passport — on a plastic airport tray. The second is “fridgescaping”, in which, besides the usual eggs, milk, butter etc, one places decorative items like flower vases and photo frames inside a refrigerator. If photos of these two trends have been lapped up by users and brand marketing departments — publishing house Faber, for example, has used the airport tray trend to pitch its season’s reads — they’ve also caused many to ask how much is too much, when it comes to the relentless glamourisation of the banal.Beyond what critics see as the obvious ludicrousness of these trends — does a fridge really need “decoration”? — they’re also marked by a troubling prioritisation of social media validation over everything else.

RBI’s shift to neutral and open doors for a trim in rates,"In the first meeting of the newly reconstituted monetary policy committee — three new external members were appointed recently — members voted 5-1 to maintain status quo on interest rates. This decision is in line with that taken at the last committee meeting in August, although then two external members had voted in favour of a cut. The departure this time was on the stance of policy. All committee members have voted in favour of changing the stance from “withdrawal of accommodation” to “neutral”. This has opened up space for the MPC to begin easing policy rates in subsequent meetings. The change in stance comes after the European Central Bank, Bank of England, and more recently, US Federal Reserve, have pivoted, beginning their rate cut cycles.The decision to change the policy stance could be attributed to “greater confidence in navigating the last mile of disinflation”. This in turn possibly comes from greater confidence over the trajectory of food prices. Food inflation has been a source of concern for the committee, even as it has declined from 8.6 per cent in February to 5.66 per cent in August. The central bank now expects prices to ease further, notwithstanding the likely uptick in the September data. Agricultural production is expected to be healthy on the back of a good monsoon season. Further, as per the RBI, there are growing prospects of a good rabi season. There are also sizable buffer stocks of foodgrain. And though the RBI Governor has voiced concerns over “unexpected weather events and worsening of geopolitical conflicts” which could have a bearing on inflation — for instance, an escalation in the conflict in the Middle East could adversely impact crude oil prices — the central bank has retained its forecast for the year at 4.5 per cent. It has now projected inflation to trend lower to 4.3 per cent in the first quarter of the next financial year. Considering expectations that core inflation will likely remain “broadly contained”, there now appears to be comfort in the “progress towards realising a durable disinflation towards the target.” ...",2024-10-01,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/rbis-shift-to-neutral-and-open-doors-for-a-trim-in-rates-9612732/,opinion

C Raja Mohan writes: Arab states – and peace – are more important than Iran or Israel,"As Iran and Israel threaten to plunge the Middle East into a dangerous regional war, India must stand by its Arab partners that are being squeezed by the conflict between the two countries. Unfortunately, there has been little appreciation of their concerns in the Indian discourse on the current phase of the conflict. The lack of public sensitivity to Arab perceptions of the conflict between Iran and Israel stands in contrast to the elevation of the engagement with the Arab world to the highest levels under the government of Narendra Modi over the last decade. Today, Iran and Israel attract significant and often passionate political support from India. Although they occupy much of India’s mind space, neither country matches the depth of India’s interests in the Arabian Peninsula.There is no question that Delhi must necessarily pursue good relations with all the key actors in the Middle East. Each of these partners brings a unique set of benefits. But any objective construction of a hierarchy of Indian interests in the Middle East will easily demonstrate the superior salience of Delhi’s ties to the Arabs. Consider the simple metric of population. With nearly 500 million people spread across 23 states, the Arab world stands apart from Israel (about 10 million) and Iran (90 million) as a major commercial, technological, political, and diplomatic market. ...",2024-10-08,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-writes-arab-states-and-peace-are-more-important-than-iran-or-israel-9608852/,opinion

Yogendra Yadav writes: How the ball turned on the Haryana field,"The instant analysis of the Haryana Assembly elections illustrates the problem with our political commentary. To borrow a cricket metaphor, we seek to explain the outcome of every match as if it was an “innings defeat”, where one team outperformed the other in every respect. Whatever the winner did was right and whatever the loser did was wrong.What makes the BJP’s victory in Haryana so politically consequential was the staggering gap between expectation and outcome, not the gap between winner and loser. The vote share gap between the BJP and Congress is less than 1 per cent. In cricket terms, the Haryana election was a T-20 match that should have been won with two overs to spare, but was dragged till the last ball, and then lost. So, we need to explain three things: Why did we expect it to be an easy affair? Why was it dragged till the last ball? Why was it lost? So, for Haryana, we need to understand the structural reasons for Congress’s perceived advantage, the strategic factors that helped the BJP neutralise it and the tactical moves that resulted in an unlikely victory for the BJP. ...",2024-10-01,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/yogendra-yadav-writes-how-the-ball-turned-on-the-haryana-field-9612750/,opinion

Ratan Tata’s final frontier: Tata group’s tryst with aviation came after decades of dejection,"Aviation was one of Ratan Tata’s personal passions.

While the father of Indian aviation and then chairman of the Tata group — JRD Tata — continued at the helm of Air India till the late 1970s, the group could not have had an airline of its own as the government did not permit private sector airlines then.But as India embraced liberalisation in the early 1990s, the country’s aviation sector also opened up for private carriers. The Tata group, too, had entered a new era with a young Ratan Tata succeeding the conglomerate’s patriarch JRD Tata as chairman.

Vettaiyan movie review: TJ Gnanavel’s take on encounter killings is burdened by predictability and the weight of Rajinikanth’s superstardom,"Vettaiyan movie review: Tamil cinema cops are trigger-happy. They have always been so, and in all probability, they will continue to be. That’s why a film like Vettaiyan is important. Tamil cinema, and even Indian cinema, needs to take a step back in glorifying the bravado of police officers when it comes to the issue of encounter killings. We have gone long enough placing the guns in the hands of cops who are shown walking sporting aviators, exuding unlimited swag, and bumping off accused without giving them their day or more in our judicial system. However, the problem with Vettaiyan is that a similar glorification of a trigger-happy cop named Athiyan (Rajinikanth) happens for far too long for the changeover to actually leave an impact.Judge Satyadev (Amitabh Bachchan), the moral compass of Vettaiyan, kickstarts proceedings by dismissing voices that refer to encounter specialists as heroes. And parallely, we see how Superintendent Athiyan isn’t patient enough to let the law take its course. His logic about extrajudicial activities is the usual argument we’ve heard in hundreds of films and thousands of real-life cases – Justice delayed is justice denied. But then, the film is also about what Amitabh Bachchan says, “Justice hurried is justice buried.” Between these two extremes lies a film that is extremely confused. ...",2024-10-01,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/vettaiyan-movie-review-rajinikanth-film-on-encounter-killings-is-burdened-by-predictability-9612846/,entertainment

Express View on Nobel Prize in Physics: The science in machine,"It might not be easy to discern the physics in a paragraph composed by ChatGPT or in talking digital assistants like Siri or the facial recognition technology used in some offices. However, the Nobel Committee’s decision to award this year’s Physics prize to the pioneers of Artificial Intelligence, which drives these services, is a recognition of machine learning’s links with the discipline in realms as diverse as processing data, particle physics and surveying the universe. It is also a salient acknowledgment of AI’s enabling and disruptive possibilities. On Tuesday, Princeton University professor John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton, professor at the University of Toronto, were awarded the Nobel for discoveries that have helped computers learn somewhat in the way the human brain does.In recent years, the Nobel Committee has shown an inclination to go beyond tradition. In 2021, for instance, the Physics prize went to three climatologists for the first time. The prize’s citations acknowledged the contributions of the scientists to understanding one of the most pressing problems facing the world. This year’s prize similarly underlines that Hopfield and Hilton’s contributions have revolutionised science, engineering, and daily life. The work of both scientists has transcended disciplinary boundaries. Hopfield began his career as a classical physicist, studying the properties of solid matter, but felt limited by the discipline. In the 1980s, he began studying how the work of neurons in the human brain could be a model for machines. His neurobiology-inspired thesis showed how a network in a machine can process information in one go, remembering all connections and patterns, unlike traditional computing in which data is stored in small bits. Hinton who has a background in Cognitive Psychology and Computer Sciences — and an abiding interest in carpentry — took forward the American scientist’s work to help machines make sense of complex data sets and patterns. The two developed on each other’s work, and that of colleagues, to increase the ability of machines to make complex associations. ...",2024-10-01,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-nobel-prize-in-physics-the-science-in-machine-9612734/,opinion

SS Rajamouli turns 51: How the visionary has become the gold standard for entertainment in India,"It was in 2007 when India attempted to participate in the Rugby World Cup for the first time. While we did not make it past the Asian Qualification, it was an important milestone. But three years earlier, a then two-film-old director called SS Rajamouli decided to make a Lagaan-esque film featuring the sport of rugby, and set it in a college campus in Hyderabad. Basically, Rajamouli decided to tell a story featuring a sport that most hadn’t seen before, and yet, managed to keep the audience engaged for over 2.5 hours. Considering the scale of the achievements of the filmmaker since then, many might not talk about Sye (2004), but I consider the film as the perfect embodiment of the SS Rajamouli brand of cinema. It didn’t matter if the story wasn’t novel. It didn’t matter if the template was familiar. There would be that SS Rajamouli touch that would elevate everything. The filmmaker’s conviction in the story he wanted to tell ensured he went all out to engage with the audience on his terms. He displayed this flair in his previous films, Student No 1 and Simhadri too. Many filmmakers before SS Rajamouli were clear that the majority of the audience needed entertainment, but he was among the select few who knew that this entertainment could truly become a phenomenon if it was backed by the right vision. A vision that told its audience that what they were going to watch wasn’t going to be just another film. They were coming for a spectacle, signed and stamped by the filmmaker, and they shouldn’t accept anything else. After Sye, Rajamouli went from strength to strength through Chatrapathi, Vikramarkudu, Yamadonga, Magadheera, Maryada Ramanna, Eega, Baahubali 1 and 2, and now, RRR.  ...",2024-10-01,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/ss-rajamouli-turns-51-how-the-visionary-has-become-the-gold-standard-for-entertainment-in-india-9612489/,entertainment

"Amitabh Bachchan slept on Marine Drive with rats as neighbours, rejected Rs 10,000 for ads because he wanted to be a star: ‘I resisted the temptation’","Amitabh Bachchan is one of the biggest superstars that Indian cinema has ever seen, and unlike many of his contemporaries, Bachchan has stayed relevant across generations. On of the biggest secrets behind his success is his evolution. As the decades passed, Bachchan kept up with the times and made sure that he wasn’t restricted by his fixed ideas. Ironically, he had very strict rules for himself when he started his career. In an earlier chat with Vir Sanghvi, Bachchan had once shared that he was against doing advertisements when he started his career, as his sole focus was to become an actor. So much so, that at one point, he rejected Rs 10,000 for an ad and was ready to sleep on the benches of Marine Drive, as he did not have much money.Amitabh Bachchan moved to Mumbai in the late 1960s after a short stint in Kolkata where he was working for a British company. Being the son of famous poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Amitabh knew that he was inclined towards the arts and wanted to become an actor. He barely had any money on him when he moved to Mumbai, but he had his driving license. The actor had the personality of a model and so, soon after landing in Mumbai, he started getting modelling opportunities for advertisements. “There were opportunities then, too, when ad agencies approached me. I was offered Rs 10,000 for an ad, which was huge money since I was earning Rs 50 a month doing radio spots. But I felt doing an ad would take something away from me and I just resisted the temptation,” he said. ...",2024-10-01,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/amitabh-bachchan-slept-on-marine-drive-with-rats-rejected-rs-10000-for-ads-9612991/,entertainment

An Expert Explains: Why battery storage is essential for a renewables-heavy electricity grid,"With India targeting to have half of its electric power capacity come from renewables by 2030, the resilience and stability of its power grid have never been more critical. Renewables, while essential for a sustainable future, come with their own set of challenges.Foremost among these is the inherent variability of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Unlike traditional energy sources that provide a consistent and predictable output, renewable energy generation fluctuates based on weather conditions, posing a risk to grid stability. The electricity grid, thus, needs to be equipped with additional flexibility that will allow power generation to be ramped up or down based on demand. ...",2024-10-09,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-battery-storage-renewables-heavy-electricity-grid-9611568/,explained

Despite that, the older child continued yelling, “Can’t you see what you’ve done? Now I’ll get scolded by Mom because of you!”Beneath that anger, though, was fear—fear of being reprimanded.

Time for Israel and Iran to reject eliminationist fantasies,"The Arabic expression “of standing on the palm of a demon (ala kaff ifrit)” describes the present situation in West Asia well — it carries the same meaning as the metaphor “teetering on a knife’s edge”.

America’s Gulf allies, namely the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are also threatened because the Iranians have hinted that their oil fields might come under attack should Iran’s installations be struck.There are forces in West Asia, led by Iran and its proxies on the one hand, and by Israel on the other, that seek to reshape through violence the political order of the entire region. There is little benefit in pointing fingers at one or the other country since both are now responsible for the present chaos. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find ways to stop them from escalating the conflict, since neither can achieve its ultimate goal and all they offer is more violence and suffering for everyone, including their own people. ...",2024-10-07,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/time-for-israel-and-iran-to-reject-eliminationist-fantasies-9607190/,opinion

Prakash Patra and Rasheed Kidwai provide a thrilling account of the Nagarwala financial scam that shook Indira Gandhi’s government,"On May 24, 1971, Ved Prakash Malhotra, head cashier at State Bank of India’s Parliament Street Branch in Delhi, received a call asking him to deposit Rs 60 lakh to a courier for a secret mission of great national interest.

Malhotra, a conscientious officer, a Partition refugee fired by a deep patriotism, saw this a chance to do his bit for the country then embroiled in the Bangladesh war, only to realise, hours later, that he had been duped.

Why RBI should cut rates in December,"The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) changed its stance to “neutral” but kept the policy rate unchanged. Undoubtedly, high food inflation has been a major constraint to wielding the scalpel. Non-food inflation stayed significantly below trend at 2.3 per cent in August, which, incidentally, matched the average of the first five months of this fiscal. We expect the MPC to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) during its December review meeting as food inflation is likely to ease. A significant upside to non-food inflation is unlikely unless geopolitical tensions intensify and affect shipping, crude oil supply and commodity costs.Global monetary policy signals have turned favourable after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its funds rate by a chunky 50 basis points bps in September — the first such move in four years. That signalled the decisive turn in the monetary policy cycle among systemically important central banks. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England had sliced rates earlier. We expect the Fed to cut rates by another 50 bps this year, followed by another 125 bps in 2025. ...",2024-10-01,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-rbi-should-cut-rates-in-december-9612751/,opinion
