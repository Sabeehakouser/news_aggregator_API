"Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes: Haryana shows BJP’s slide is overstated. In J-K, National Conference’s resilience wins","Haryana is a small state. But the BJP’s historic victory, for a third term, has significant consequences nationally. For one thing, this election is a massive shot in the arm for the BJP and a shock for Congress. There is a lot of local analysis to be done, and the mathematics of vote share-to-seat share conversion doubtless played a role in this election. Those kinds of tactical issues matter. But there is no getting away from a couple of large messages. The first is that predictions of the BJP’s slide after the setback of June 4 are greatly exaggerated. Winning a third term in a state where the BJP does not have the kind of default cultural identification it has in Gujarat or Madhya Pradesh is no mean feat. It will give pause to those who were beginning to doubt the BJP’s tactical acumen. To use Milan Vaishnav’s phrase, the BJP-led Fourth Party System is still resilient.By the same token, this defeat is a shock for the Congress. There has not been another state election where it has, in principle, had as clear a path to power as in Haryana. There was momentum behind it. Even the BJP was conceding to challenges on a number of fronts: Corruption, unemployment, agrarian distress and urban dysfunction. To fritter this opportunity will hurt; it changes the momentum of Indian politics. It strengthens Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was beginning to look very shaky, and is indicative still of a large residual resistance to accepting Rahul Gandhi. It is a little unfair to make these judgements on every election. But confidence in the Congress’s tactical judgements will be dented. Its impressive vote share suggests that Congress has the potential to consolidate anti-BJP sentiment behind itself. But its internal rivalries are still too close to the surface. Its two attempted master narratives, one on caste and the other on farmers, are not enough to consolidate an electoral strategy, and may even backfire under some circumstances. This is because both narratives fall prey to social determinism. They quite simply underestimate the churn in rural India. Both caste and class identities are more complicated. It is an unmistakable trend that communities can now vote for different parties. They also underestimate the new contradictions this social churn produces. ...",2024-10-09,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/haryana-bjp-slide-overstated-jk-national-conferences-resilience-9610234/,opinion
The Platform 2 movie review: Flat follow-up to Netflix’s sensational hit serves leftovers to loyal fans,"If The Platform presented a Darwinian allegory, The Platform 2 is a metaphor for organised religion. It’s as if the unlikely Netflix franchise is tracing the very evolution of human existence. What next; the dark ages? Having released in the earliest stages of the pandemic in 2020, The Platform became a runaway hit — a movie about mass incarceration that was fantastical enough to not seem like a reflection of reality; at least, not the one that everyone was living in that moment. With its on-the-nose symbolism and sweeping social commentary, The Platform isn’t the only pre-pandemic sensation to have spawned a sequel in recent days.But unlike Joker: Folie à Deux, which boldly deviates from its predecessor in interesting ways, The Platform 2 is more like Bird Box: Barcelona, the recent sequel to another of Netflix’s 2020 hits. Bird Box: Barcelona also shed the minimalism that made the original Bird Box so interesting, devoting itself instead to establishing dense lore. The Platform 2, for at least the first half, so closely resembles the original that you’re likely going to wonder if you’re watching a pointless rehash. But in the second half, the movie switches gears violently, as it sheds a drab aesthetic in favour of something more grandiose. ...",2024-10-09,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/the-platform-2-movie-review-a-flat-follow-up-to-netflix-sensational-hit-9609790/,entertainment

"For older Indians, walking 9,000 steps every day is the best way to cut risk of heart attack by 50 per cent","Have you ever wondered why Indians carry such a disease burden? That’s because over 50 per cent of Indians do not meet the minimum physical activity recommendation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity.“There is a lack of awareness about physical activity guidelines. Hence, simpler metrics such as counting steps can be useful to promote physical activity in India,” says Shivangi Bajpai, a doctoral student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Department of Kinesiology, US.

UK-Mauritius Chagos Deal: Crossroads for India’s strategic autonomy,"The UK’s decision to transfer sovereignty of the strategically significant Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius marks a watershed moment in international relations and maritime geopolitics. This long-standing issue, once deemed unresolvable, had simmered for decades until London, in a pragmatic move, settled it earlier this week to the apparent satisfaction of key stakeholders while securing its own strategic interests. The transfer not only addresses the colonial legacies of the past but also reshapes power dynamics in the Indian Ocean, with significant implications for maritime strategy and regional security.In many ways, this outcome was inevitable, given the mounting pressure on the UK from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN General Assembly, and several regional states, including India, which has consistently backed Mauritius’ claim. India, in particular, has been a vocal advocate for the decolonisation agenda, reinforcing the Mauritian cause and asserting its leadership role in the Global South. With its diplomatic stance under increasing scrutiny, the UK likely saw this handover as a necessary move to align with the international consensus in favour of Port Louis. ...",2024-10-09,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/uk-mauritius-chagos-deal-crossroads-for-indias-strategic-autonomy-9611343/,opinion

"Rekha at 70: A look at the actor, the enigma and her cinematic and fashion legacy","Resplendent as the talented poet and courtesan in the Lucknow of the 1840s, she inhabits the unforgettable titular character of Umrao Jaan (1981). As a raging mother-turned-model, she headlines one of Indian cinema’s most popular revenge dramas, Khoon Bhari Maang (1988), where she survives a crocodile attack to avenge the betrayal of her most-trusted. In the titular role in campy Madam X (1994), she is a ruthless revolver-wielding gangster who loves to flaunt over-the-top costumes and mouths outlandish dialogues. Nearly seven years later, in Zubeidaa (2001), she delivers a compelling performance as the dignified and supportive first wife of a Maharaja. One of the most versatile and acclaimed actresses of Indian cinema — Rekha — has brought multiple memorable characters to life by refusing to be pigeonholed.Just like her kaleidoscopic film career, Rekha, too, has many facets. Poised to embrace the septuagenarian status — Rekha turns 70 on October 10 — she redefined ageing with a captivating 20-minute dance performance at a recent award function. The glamourous actor is also one of India’s greatest style icons. Gulzar, who fondly calls her ‘Kalu Baba’, describes her as a “livewire”. Yet, she is famously reclusive. Regardless, she can be a habitual scene-stealer. She creates viral moments when she lovingly kisses Richa Chadha’s baby bump at a Heeramandi event; dances with Sonakshi Sinha at her wedding reception; and showers love on Janhvi Kapoor at the latter’s movie screening. To be able to orchestrate attention-grabbing pop culture moments, while retaining the enigma around her, has long been Rekha’s superpower. The limelight unabashedly courts her when she appears in public in her gorgeous kanjeevarams, exquisite jewellery, gajra in hair, potli in hand and sindoor in her maang. ...",2024-10-06,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/rekha-at-70-a-look-at-the-actor-the-enigma-and-her-cinematic-and-fashion-legacy-9604612/,express-sunday-eye

Express View on Jaishankar’s Pakistan visit: A long road ahead,"There is a frisson of anticipation ahead of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s visit to Pakistan on October 15-16 for the summit-level meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). After all, the last time an Indian Foreign Minister was in the country was nine years ago when Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad for the Heart of Asia Conference on Afghanistan in December 2015. Her trip was followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi going to Lahore to meet then-Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif. Since then, however, the bilateral relationship has been on a downward trajectory. A thaw in ties seems unlikely in the near term.The elephant in the room remains Pakistan’s use of cross-border terror as a part of its security and strategic calculus. Despite the fact that its support for extremist groups has had grave consequences domestically, Rawalpindi continues to support separatist elements across the border. As Minister Jaishankar said at an event in New Delhi on Saturday, “if you’re all sitting together and cooperating, and at the same time, you know this kind of terrorism go(ing) on openly… in which case, you are normalising it, you are accepting that this is a legitimate tool of statecraft.” It is for this reason that the SAARC has become nearly defunct. Islamabad, for its part, is stuck with the maximalist position it took in the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. Its stand that Delhi must undo the change in Jammu & Kashmir’s constitutional status as a precursor for dialogue cannot now be softened without political consequences domestically. ...",2024-10-08,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-jaishankars-pakistan-visit-a-long-road-ahead-9608823/,opinion

On Tuesday in Dubai, there was another similarity as the two sat down for their press conferences ahead of the all-important clash between India and Sri Lanka at the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup. Both of them were left wondering about their own batting form in what have been tough conditions in the UAE for run-scoring.The Asia Cup final rematch on Wednesday will likely decide the fate of the losing team in the tournament. Asian champions Sri Lanka have underperformed so far and are in a much more precarious situation than India, having lost two out of two. But India’s situation is not great either, despite getting off the mark with a win against Pakistan.

"Manvat Murders, Sector 36, The Buckingham Murders: Content with crimes against children highlights the dysfunctional adults around them","No matter how seasoned a professional you are or how objectively you feel you can view content, watching shows or films that involve crimes against children is a deeply unsettling experience, especially for a parent. Stories where children are victims of assault and murder force you to confront your fears of not being able to protect them from the monsters around you. Over the past month, I watched two films and one web series (Sector 36 on Netflix, The Buckingham Murders and Manvat Murders on SonyLIV), that tell horrifying tales of crimes committed against children. What struck me though is that in trying to understand the motive behind such brutality and finding the person or people responsible, a larger and more complex web of problems emerged. While the actual crime is committed by one or two individuals, poverty, patriarchy and people in power abet these horrifying acts of crime. ...",2024-10-09,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/manvat-murders-sector-36-the-buckingham-murders-content-with-crimes-against-children-highlights-the-dysfunctional-adults-around-them-9610968/,entertainment
Tavleen Singh writes: Fiscal ruin in near future,"A crime is being committed by our political leaders that is likely to have immense and irreversible consequences and it worries me that it has gone almost unnoticed. This is the crime of turning voters once more into supplicants. They were forced to be supplicants in those socialist decades when Congress ruled most of India. We had just got rid of the British and political leaders enjoyed being benefactors, or as we say in Hindi as the ‘mai-baap sarkar’. This literally means the government is our mother and father. In rural parts of our ancient land, you need only visit the Collector’s office to see that these mighty officials continue to treat people as supplicants.The Collector is a colonial post that should have been abolished long ago but inexplicably still exists. This official is so powerful that he behaves like a provincial potentate. He usually lives in the grandest bungalow, usually set in sprawling gardens and, if it is an old British official’s house, can also have a tennis court and swimming pool on the premises. Outside the Collector’s heavily secured palace are to be found, at a safe distance, queues of anxious people who sometimes come repeatedly for a small matter to be settled. In the old days I used to see people groveling, with their hands joined in supplication, when they were granted an audience with the ‘Burra Sahib.’ ...",2024-10-06,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/tavleen-singh-writes-fiscal-ruin-in-near-future-9605676/,opinion

"Express View on Haryana, J&K poll results: Two decisive wins & one sore, irresponsible loser","THE ASSEMBLY polls in Jammu & Kashmir and Haryana took place together, but their outcomes are momentous in different ways. In J&K, there is a need to pause at the election itself before taking stock of the result. After all, this contest came after a decade of electionlessness in the erstwhile state and five years after it was stripped of its special status by the abrogation of Article 370 and split into two Union Territories. The Supreme Court laid down a deadline, the Centre respected it and the Election Commission stepped up to the challenge of holding an election, despite the surge of violence in the Jammu region. Now the National Conference’s remarkable achievement — it has held together through great adversity and in alliance with the Congress, crossed the halfway mark — must take second place to the trust reposed in the power of the vote by the J&K electorate. Commendably, and in a constitutional democracy, hearteningly, the people of J&K have cast aside narratives of alienation and boycott politics and embraced a new consensus on political participation and electoral engagement.In Haryana, the BJP has coursed to a historic third consecutive win in a state that is not a traditional bastion. Its victory, only months after the unambiguous setback in the Lok Sabha verdict in June, speaks of the party’s ability to get back on its feet again and go for the win. For students of Indian politics, it is a cautionary tale — this country’s politics retains its ability to spring a surprise. But it seems that the story of the Haryana election is not yet over even after the votes have been counted — and therein lies a second cautionary tale. ...",2024-10-09,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-haryana-jk-poll-results-two-decisive-wins-one-sore-irresponsible-loser-9610836/,opinion

A report by Boston Consulting Group earlier this year found that around 84 per cent Indian smartphone users check their phones within 15 minutes of waking up. As glaring as that number is, the damage it can do to one’s daily lives is far more alarming.According to experts, when you wake up in the morning, your brain moves from delta state (restful) to theta state, a kind of dreamy state, and later to alpha state, a stage when you are awake but not fully processing information.

How we went from charming to rescuing snakes,"In the ‘old days’ if you found a snake in your garden, you screamed and sent for the snake charmer. If he was not too busy entertaining a crowd with his basketful of deadly if defanged cobras and his been (a musical wind instrument) and maybe a mongoose, he would come over and find the snake. Well, he had to because otherwise he would have had none, to entertain you with. So India earned a reputation of being a land of snake charmers.Today, there’s a new breed of snake charmers around in Africa, Australia, the United States and India: usually comprising gung-ho young men or women, or couples who love snakes and do their best for them. This means, rescuing them from unsuitable locations and releasing them in areas more congenial to the reptiles. And since this is the age of information, the whole procedure is professionally videoed and made into a production complete with suitable background music scores. ...",2024-10-03,Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/how-we-went-from-charming-to-rescuing-snakes-9601909/,express-sunday-eye
